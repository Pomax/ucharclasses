Sometimes you don't want to have to bother with font switching
just because you're languages that are distinct enough to use
different unicode blocks, but aren't covered by the polyglossia
package. Where normal word processing packages such as MS, 
Star- or OpenOffice pretty much handle this for you, LaTeX
(because it needs you to tell it what to do) has no default
behaviour for this, and so we arrive at a need for a package
that does this for us. You already discovered that regular LaTeX
has no understanding of unicode (in fact, it has no understanding
of 8-bit characters at all, it likes them in seven bits instead),
and ended up going for Xe(La)TeX as your TeX compiler of choice,
which means you now have two excellent resources available:

  fontspec, and ucharclasses.

The first of these lets you pick fonts based on what your system
calls them, without needing to rewrite them as metafont files.
This is convenient. This is good. The second lets you define what
should happen when we change from a character in one unicode block,
to a character in another. This is also convenient, and paired with
fontspec it offers automatic fontswitching in the same way that
normal Office applications take care of this with you. With one big
difference: you stay in control. If at some point you need the switch
rule to use a completely different rule, in an Office application
that's just too bad for you. In Xe(La)TeX, you stay on top of things
and still get to say exactly what happens, and when.
